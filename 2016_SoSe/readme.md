# Final Project - Video based generative poster

For the final project you will write a Processing program that uses video as input, and will generate vector graphics as output. You will run the same program three times, with three different video files, to obtain three layers to be printed as one poster. The layers can be combined with an external program (like Inkscape or Illustrator) or directly in Processing by writing a program

The video files should be between 30 seconds and 3 minutes long, and they should depict natural fenomena. You can record short video clips with your phone and copy the files to your computer. Some ideas for videos: moving or flowing water, waves, plants or leaves moved by wind, clouds, sky timelapses, walking through nature, pointing the camera towards the sun and moving the camera to create patterns, etc.

Programs 048 and 049 can be used as a starting point. They show how to input video into Processing, and how to read pixel properties. There are many properties you can observe in the video file from your program. For instance, you can read the hue, saturation, brightness, red, green and blue values for any pixel on the video frames. You can always focus on the same pixel (the center one, the pixel (100, 100), the top-left one). Or you can observe multiple pixels. For instance, you could study the difference in brightness between two pixels, situated at (25%, 50%) and (75%, 50%), and use that to control any property (position, size, rotation, color, thickness, etc).

The goal is to experiment, to connect properties obtained from the video file into properties that control the drawing process and see what happens. By doing this, obtain unique and interesting aesthetics and learn what works and what does not.

The resulting PDF files will be printed and displayed at the Rundgang at the end of July. The size and print quality is yet to be determined, but assume a portrait poster between sizes A3 and A1.

I suggest you send me via e-mail work in progress and questions so I can provide feedback before the deadline (the Rundgang date).

Have fun experimenting! :)
